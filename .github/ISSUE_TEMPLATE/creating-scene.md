_Every new protocol starts with some basic preparation work. In this document we will talk about every step that needs to be done in scene preparation._

## Starting a new FEATURE branch from develop branch. 
First thing we should do is create a FEATURE new branch in source tree in which everything for that scene will be build. 
1. Go to source tree an make sure you are in develop branch

2. Click the gitflow icon and choose 'New feature'

3. Name branch accordingly starting with 'Protocol_' & click 'ok'

The branch is now created and you can start preparation work.   

_!!!Remember to push your preparation work so others can later pull it from remote!!!_  

## Creating a new scene
When creating a new scene it is best to first take a look if protocol looks like a scene we allready have. You can duplicate this scene so basic scene work is in scene (basic scene work explanation: https://github.com/GijsTempel/care-up/wiki/Basic-scene-work)  

_!!!Make sure new scene names always start with 'Scenes__'._That way people can quickly find scenes in project folder by typing Scenes___!!!_
