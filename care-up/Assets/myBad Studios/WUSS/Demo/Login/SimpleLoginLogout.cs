    /// scrpt does and you are free to design your own GUI using NGUI or any other system you want. 
    /// Everything you need pre-and post login is all contained inside of WULogin.cs
    /// 
    /// To use this demonstration code:
    /// 1. Drop this script on a Button on a Canvas
    /// 2. Add the WPServer component to the scene.
    /// 3. Enter your username and password into the fields below
